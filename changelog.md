## Version 4.3
•  It continuously sets their oom_score_adj to -1000 and optionally applies legacy oom_adj if supported by the kernel.
•  Boosts performance by increasing CPU scheduling priority (renice -18) for these apps.
•  Includes a watchdog that automatically restarts PolygonX's foreground service if the app is killed or crashes.
•  Features smart handling of Pokémon GO PID changes, pausing adjustments temporarily to avoid conflicts.
•  Includes dynamic log rotation to maintain a lightweight, readable logfile.

• Memory Optimization (🆕 !)
• Drop_caches loop: Frees up system RAM every 30 seconds if memory is low.
• LRU memory deprioritizer: Scans Android’s Least Recently Used (LRU) process list and:
• • Force-stops CACHED_EMPTY apps (procState 19).
• • Sets oom_score_adj to 999 for less critical background processes (procState 14–18) to help LMK prioritize better.
